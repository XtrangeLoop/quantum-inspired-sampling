# quantum-inspired-sampling
Basic example of quantum-inspired sampling

Jupyter notebook implementing the post-ptocessed 
perturbed coin process example introduced in 
Sec. III B 2 of Realpe-GÃ³mez, J & Killoran, N.:
"Quantum-inspired memory-enhanced stochastic algorithms"
[arXiv:1906.00263]. 
This example was implemented experimentally with quantum
technologies by Ghafari et al. [arXiv:1812.04251].
